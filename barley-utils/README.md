# `barley-utils`

#### THIS CRATE IS DEPRECATED. All of its functionality is being moved into separate packages.

This crate provides various utilities for the barley workflow engine. It is not technically required for the engine to function, but it is highly recommended. It provides many useful actions for common tasks, such as HTTP fetching and file I/O.

`barley-utils` is not stable. It is available as a pre-release for testing purposes.

See the [`barley-interface` crate](https://crates.io/crates/barley-runtime) for an example of how to use this crate.
